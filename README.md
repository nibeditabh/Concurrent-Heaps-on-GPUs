# Concurrent-Heaps-on-GPUs
 The code is an implementation of the algorithm detailed in the paper: "Accelerating concurrent heaps on GPUS" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06504)<br>

1. Run  'make all' to compile and create the executable 'test'. <br>
2. Run ./test <input file> to get the output. <br>
3.<b>sample_inputs</b> folder contains 4 sample inputs to test the functionality. <br>
4.<b>input1.txt</b>,<b>input3.txt</b> contains inputs for Parallel Insertion and Parallel Deletion Operation. <br>
5.<b>input2.txt</b>, <b>input4.txt</b> contains inputs for Concurrent Insertion-Deletion Operation. <br>
